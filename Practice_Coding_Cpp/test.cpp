// I am a Hindu from Bangladesh, and I can assure you that every single minority, including Hindus, Buddhists, and Christians, is not safe in Bangladesh. Hindu temples, homes, and businesses are being set on fire, and young women are being raped. Thousands of Hindus are trying to flee to the neighboring country, India. Minorities, especially Hindus and Buddhists, will not last much longer in Bangladesh.

// I really appreciate your efforts to spread awareness about the suffering of Hindus. Please, create a message in English so that the whole world can know what the minorities in Bangladesh are going through. Bangladeshi Muslims fear international attention on what they are doing to us, especially from India. That is the only thing keeping us alive now! So, please, help us spread the word as much as possible. We don't want another Pakistan for Hindus.
